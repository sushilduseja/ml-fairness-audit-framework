## Pricing Methodology

### Value-Based Approach

**Value Components:**
1. Regulatory risk mitigation (enforcement action avoidance)
2. Operational efficiency (vs. manual testing)
3. Audit preparation (examination readiness)
4. Knowledge standardization (vs. individual expertise)

**Pricing Principle:** Capture fraction of delivered value

### Competitive Benchmarking

**Framework:**
- Position relative to enterprise competitors (lower)
- Position relative to open source (value-add justification)
- Position relative to DIY (total cost of ownership comparison)

## Go-to-Market Pricing Tactics

### Launch Strategy
- Early adopter incentives
- Pilot programs
- Multi-year commitments

### Freemium Consideration

**Evaluated Options:**
- Free tier with limited features
- Time-limited free trials
- Freemium vs. sales-led motion

**Decision Framework:** B2B financial services context favors sales-led over freemium due to:
- Complex stakeholder buying process
- Compliance-driven purchasing
- Support intensity requirements

**Recommended:** Free trial program over freemium
