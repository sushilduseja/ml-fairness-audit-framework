## Customer Success Stories (Proof Points)

### Story 1: European Bank (Pilot)

**Situation:** Bank deploying new credit scoring model; EU AI Act compliance required by 2025

**Challenge:** Manual fairness testing would take 6 weeks; deployment deadline 8 weeks away

**Solution:** Used ML Fairness Audit Framework
- Submitted predictions + features
- Ran 4 core metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds, calibration, predictive equality)
- Generated PDF report in 2 hours

**Result:**
- Metrics showed 4% approval disparity (PASS)
- Provided audit-ready documentation
- Deployed with regulatory confidence

**Quote:** "We saved 4 weeks of data science time and have confidence in our compliance posture. The report was exactly what regulators wanted to see."

### Story 2: US FinTech (Alternative Lender)

**Situation:** Rapid model iterations; need to test fairness quickly without slowing deployment

**Challenge:** Open-source tools required data science expertise; frameworks weren't user-friendly for risk team

**Solution:** Used API for automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Submit predictions after model training
- Get fairness report automatically
- Risk team reviews via dashboard

**Result:**
- Test cycle time: <2 hours (vs. weeks)
- Consistent testing across 12 models
- Risk team can approve independently

**Quote:** "This tool made fairness testing something we do routinely, not something we dread. It's now part of our standard deployment process."
